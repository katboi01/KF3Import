A 3ds max macro script to instantly bring Kemono Friends 3 models to a usable state.

It edits normals for all face parts so there are no seams when rendering.

Currently it only supports 1 character at a time, and it doesn't work with meshes that use more than 1 material (eg. Ostrich, Shiservals)

It requires input files to be exported with Perfare's Assetstudio, detailed explanation and guide can be accessed via a button in the script
